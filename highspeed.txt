If ACK is received:
    if cwnd < 38:
        alpha = 1           // Normal TCP Reno behavior
        beta = 0.5
    else:
        // Use lookup table to get alpha value based on the cwnd
        alpha = lookupAlpha(cwnd)

    // Increase cwnd based on alpha
    cwnd = cwnd + (alpha / cwnd)

If packet loss is detected:
    // Reduce cwnd by factor beta (less aggressive than TCP Reno)
    // Use lookup table to get beta value based on the cwnd
    beta = lookupBeta(cwnd)

    // Maintain cwnd based on beta value
    cwnd = cwnd * beta
