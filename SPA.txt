For each subflow path_i during congestion control:

  //First compute the path quality
  R_i = (lp_max / RTT_min^2) / (lp_i / RTT_i^2)

  //Then classify the paths based on this
  If R_i > Threshold:
    Mark path_i as BAD_PATH

    // Suppress the path's aggressiveness
    snd_cwnd_i = min_cwnd
    ss_thresh_i = snd_cwnd_i

  Else:
    Unmark path_i (restore its normal behavior)

During packet scheduling:

  For each path_i:

    If path_i is marked as BAD_PATH:
      // Replicate packets assigned to bad path
      Retransmit those packets via the fastest GOOD_PATH

    Else:
      // Transmit as usual
      Schedule packets normally
